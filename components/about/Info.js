            Hi there.
            <br />I like to add flavor to every{" "}
            <span className={styles.underline}>digital experience</span>.
            <br />I work on and have a sweet tooth for anything related to{" "}
            <span className={styles.underline}>interface</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            More informations: Over the past few years, thanks to various
            exchanges with caring and talented people, I have grown and learned
            as much as a designer as a person.
            <br />
            <br /> Through my experiences, I have been able to clarify and be
            more aware of the type of environment and the mindset I strive for
            in a company.
